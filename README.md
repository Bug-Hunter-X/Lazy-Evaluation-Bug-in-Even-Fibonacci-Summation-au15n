This repository demonstrates a common Haskell bug stemming from the language's lazy evaluation. The `bug.hs` file contains a function that incorrectly calculates the sum of even Fibonacci numbers due to generating an infinite list. The `bugSolution.hs` file provides a corrected version using efficient techniques to avoid this issue.  The problem highlights the importance of careful consideration of lazy evaluation when working with potentially infinite data structures in Haskell.
